=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

    [MungeFile::WithData]
    file = lib/My/Module.pm
    house = maison

And during the build, F<lib/My/Module.pm>:

    my ${{ $house }} = 'my castle';

Is transformed to:

    my $maison = 'my castle';

=head1 WARNING!

This is not the feature set that is intended to be provided by this plugin.
Use with discretion until the interface and featurs have stabilized!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a C<FileMunger> plugin for L<Dist::Zilla> that passes the main module
through a L<Text::Template>, with a variable provided that contain the
content from the file's C<__DATA__> section.

L<Text::Template> is used to transform the file by making the C<< $DATA >>
variable available to all code blocks within C<< {{ }} >> sections.

The module being transformed is loaded first, before the template content is
transformed, in order to extract the C<__DATA__> section. While it would seem
that the module will not compile in this state, it is possible to craft the
file content in order to allow the file to parse (e.g. see
L<Acme::CPANAuthors::Nonhuman> version 0.005).

This is a wacky idea though (ether discovered she could be I<clever>! What
fun!) and this will not be a permanent feature of this plugin - in the future
it is intended that the C<__DATA__> section will instead be extracted by
scanning the file for C<< qr/^__DATA__$/ >>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=begin :list

* C<finder>

This is the name of a L<FileFinder|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinder> for finding
files to modify.

Other pre-defined finders are listed in
L<FileFinder|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinderUser/default_finders>.
You can define your own with the
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FileFinder::ByName|[FileFinder::ByName]> plugin.

The default is C<:MainModule>.

=end :list

=head1 BACKGROUND

This module was originally a part of the L<Acme::CPANAuthors::Nonhuman>
distribution, used to transform a C<DATA> section containing a list of PAUSE
ids to their corresponding names, as well as embedded HTML with everyone's
avatar images.
